                The project has a big purpose. We mainly discused something out of the box behind this. Eventhough we never get into this position, we purely believe that some people specifically woman and children are in danger of violance cases everyday.

                I was in a bad situation while my lecturer told me to join the Google Bangkit Academy Program. Everything is under unpredictable time, I was not expected to get accepted as one of 3000 thousands students all over this nation. I just read that 40.000 applicants students were also fought to get in this program. How did I know this? I didn't know weather I should happy or not.

                Long short story, I found my self grow to a better direction as a young person. This program taught me a lot more than I just need when I was in college. Covid was everywhere disrupted motivations and life, but I found this just like a light of fire in a darkness spot. Along with classes and mentoring later on I realize this program was like show me a way to be a alive. My first time introduced with <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Fundamental Web Programming</span> in Dicoding online course platform. But this is just a beginning.

                As a college student, it was a very lucky to joined in this program. Life is not only about code and debuging, but also how can I prepare myself to talk with strangers out there. I learned how to embrace my <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Life Path</span> so that I could get the experience that maybe usefull for me in the future, <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Negotiation</span> was also my fav subject in this program since it's mandatory to practice and fun to do this in realife situation, there are so many softskill classes but I just found this one called <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Woman International Day</span> that provide an online conference event.

                I learned how to maximize our potential skill in industry circumstances probably in a company. Senior Lead Marketing from Google who also an indonesian woman ilustrated in 3 things called PIE stands for <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Performance</span>, <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Image</span>, and the last is <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Exposure</span>. I mean, wow that's a huge meaning. I was so inspired until today.

                We headed to the maincourse; Capstone Project of Bangkit Academy. Topic that we took at that time was from The Ministry of Woman and Child Protection Indonesia. They have a problem with customer service staff who had a difficulties to handle so many questions and reporting cases in a single time. The amount of customer services were so small and they have to receive messages from all over indonesia. It sounds terrible right? <span class="fw-bold">Imagine if there was an urgent violance in Papua and no one can reported this imediately just because they should wait until the other case has successfully received.</span> Honestly i was worried in that time, cause who might think about innovation that is trully from reallife problem in this country? No one can deny. But I have to. I tried to think positive, put everything in efforts to get done all this mandatory project together with my teammates.

                Since a was accepted as a cloud computing student, I handled the back-end environment in GCP. It was my first ever time build environment through big platform, utilizing linux terminal, made a virtual private cloud network, installed any pre-requirement before deploying models and app, reserve an external IP, practiced to host a model with ngrox web hosting, triggered my team motivation everyday, lead all members to always keep up with the time, always did communicate everthing that we might not known before, we were still zero but still fight with everything. Until the day of final project persentation came up, we were ready.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                It was very challenging. Worked with a team we didn't know before and we should managed anything by all rules. If i was not prepared with <span class="badge text-bg-dark">Growth Mindset</span> class and implemented that value in Bangkit, I might not graduate from this program so well. But it was a journey of exploring. Bless to Me.
